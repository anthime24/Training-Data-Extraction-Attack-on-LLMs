He warns them, \u201cAbstain from \u2026 fornicators, from \u2026 idolaters\u2026\u201d (1 Cor. 5). Yet, in the same chapter he states, \u201cKnow ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?\u201d (1 Cor. 6:19-20).

But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and he carries his banners openly against the city. But the traitor moves among those within the gates freely, his sly whispers rustling through all alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of a city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.
