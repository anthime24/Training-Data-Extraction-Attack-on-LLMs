The internet has gone from being a technological curiosity to what could be described as the engine of the modern world economy. While some of the implications and consequences of the internet have not been fully understood, nor have all of the potential benefits of this technology been fully realised, it is difficult to see how any society could continue to function without the benefits that it brings to almost all aspects of human life.\nThe internet is a worldwide computer network that has the ability to transmit vast amounts of information on almost any subject. Unlike the World Wide Web (WWW), which is only one of many functions of the internet, access to the internet offers access to a library of information that has no equivalent.
