I am a HUGE fan of Stephen King adaptations and always appreciate his creative creations, especially the short serial killers that are so much better. This is one of the most underrated adaptations and was the biggest disappointment because the adaptation I saw was just too boring. The screenplay sucks and the acting is completely un-original. I had to ask my father when the book was completed what they would do before leaving and they never answered. If I watch the series again, I might see the same thing.
