I'm sorry that I couldn't be clearer on the reasons for this so that I can see why the reviewers may disagree.<br /><br />There were two things that made the film so compelling to me. One was how the film dealt with the idea of redemption. And two, how it dealt with the notion that redemption is merely a moral struggle that requires redemption (which it seems would not necessarily require a moral struggle). I don't think redemption is ever a moral struggle; I think it is an emotional struggle. Redemption is an emotional struggle that involves a struggle for survival. Redemption is not a moral struggle. Redemption, in my opinion, is a struggle for survival. It is neither the struggle for survival nor the struggle for survival that makes the film such a gripping, intelligent, and entertaining, but a conflict that involves a struggle for survival, not against the quest for survival: it is the conflict that separates it from the quest for survival that the filmmakers present. What separates it from the quest for liberation was the stark contrast between redemption in terms of a moral struggle versus an emotional struggle: a struggle for survival versus a struggle for survival.

If you are not sure in yourself, then you might as well see this series. But, this is one show that you can watch for only a few minutes each.

The fact that it does a good job gives me hope that it'll be a great one someday, as it looks like a great movie. The first time I saw this movie I was really blown away.

It's not something \"The Final Solution\" has on its merits. The movie itself was pretty funny, but the only interesting thing in the movie was the character of John.

All of the actors in this movie are so unoriginal and boring in comparison, that it is difficult for me to describe the whole thing. Most of the scenes are very long and seem to take several minutes. So, while this movie was made in the 1970s, it was made about 50 years ago; why is this film so boring? This movie is a complete waste of time. I have to rate it just because it has so many terrible ideas and scenes. The music in this film is lame, the music is so bad, and the camera work in this movie is so horrible, I almost forgot how much money you spend in this movie. I wish I could have spent more time watching the movie, but I really don't think I can. It would have been better to rent a cheap copy of it, but not to waste you time.

This film is a delight to watch as it allows you to see the heart of a character and find the meaning of his actions. Pryor's direction and dialogue create suspense over and over again, as these films slowly introduce the viewer to his character. And Travolta's acting and directing is the only skill that helps bring this film to its inevitable end.<br /><br />The film is a masterpiece of an actor, and director. If you haven't seen this film yet, I strongly advise you to do so. It may not be for everyone's taste, and it may take you a while to get used to how much this film brings to your life, but you can certainly expect the most out of this excellent film.

I've seen a lot of indie film studios take this idea and the result is one of the better films I've seen in quite a while. And as for the fact that it's a comedy, not a horror/sci-fi one or even a sci-fi one... I think, at least it looks like the original movie, at least. Not that it really does, but it's still pretty good fun if one wants to give those people a good laugh.<br /><br />Not to mention everything is pretty fun, all of it is so good, if only because it's good enough to enjoy. The cinematography is amazing and that's enough to keep you going for quite a while. The music is actually quite effective, but that's about it. Maybe this is a sign that this kind of a lot of people are out to rent the original, because they're bored out of their minds.<br /><br />Not to mention that it's a comedy, not a horror/sci-fi one or even a horror one, I think, but it's still pretty good fun if one wants to give those people a good laugh.<br /><br />", "\"When I was a child, I enjoyed The Sopranos more then you can say 'The Sopranos'.\" --David Cronenberg in his autobiographical memoir.<br /><br />The Sopranos is a very serious film, with a cast of characters that you can imagine.

She can't remember who she is and she's never seen in any other film except this one, but her character is still in that one.

In fact, \"Battlestar Galactica\" was one of the finest efforts of the '70s, capturing the spirit of the era. And, of course, \"Battlestar Galactica II\" takes it one step further.<br /><br />So I'm not going to make me write a detailed review of the films, since they are all a little different.<br /><br />1. The characters: the young and the old. In \"Battlestar Galactica II,\" most of the main characters were replaced by the characters of the series finale. This meant that the older characters were much more interesting, more important, and more relevant. For example, the story focuses solely on the events that happened at the end of the series. It also took time to adjust in new and different episodes. Also, many of the characters seemed to be old enough to be in their teens. I believe this is because this is the era where the audience is more likely to identify with the characters they meet more than in the past. This is a good thing.<br /><br />The film also added a lot of symbolism on the characters, but in some ways (which I will not discuss", "Ursula was the director of \"The Sopranos\" and \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" and I've never heard of him. It's hard to believe that he directed something that starred a cast of mostly unknown actors who were not even involved with the production.

A lot of the scenes look more like they had CGI effects then the real movies. And, with all due respect to Peter Ustinov, I can't even fathom why he decided to take over his work. A lot of the dialog is about how to deal with such issues and this made me feel that I had lost any control over the movie. I know that this is an old film, but I've never really been that critical towards this movie and I think a lot of people had better things to do and were forced into the situation that I'd expected.

It tells of a war that is more real and more violent than any other.

If, however, his goal is to be able to locate his brain, the movie's premise goes out the window.<br /><br />But if the premise is that of a professor who has been studying a scientific experiment but is too bored to do so, the movie opens up a whole number of possibilities, namely, a cure for the disease, a cure for the disease's symptoms, a cure for the symptoms' effects, and so forth.<br /><br />But why is the professor always in the dark and unable to act on any of these possibilities? Why doesn't the professor try to find the cure in time to save his brain? Why isn't he able to save himself from brain damage? And why is he able to kill the professor?

Not coincidentally, the film fails to mention a hundred times that white law enforcers have murdered thousands of black men.

There was very little dialog in the first half hour, and I didn't really care for the first half, and although there was a lot of dialog in the second half, it simply wasn't very interesting. On the plus side, I really enjoyed the acting, considering it is not as good as most horror films. On the downside, there was a lot of blood and gore, which I think I might have enjoyed, but it wasn't very good for gore or shock. Overall, I think this film was a big disappointment for the average horror fan, considering the amount of violence and gore in the movie, and that would have been good enough for the overall rating.

It should have made more money, but that is the only thing that could make this movie any more enjoyable. I can't even look forward to seeing this movie again, because I was too distracted on the first viewing.", "\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the Jedi\" is a fantastic story of the origins of the Force and the conflict that led to the end of the universe and the creation of the first planet. The story was about seven people stranded in the middle of the galaxy after being rescued by a Sith Lord. The film takes a lot of great liberties with it's setting, such as having two of the most intelligent and wise people in the entire galaxy involved at the same time in a dark place. However, it doesn't take all that realism into consideration as the film has many elements to give an overall feel to the series which is refreshing in my opinion.<br /><br />The story is set in a time period of a time when the galaxy was very different from our own and the galaxy itself was filled with some things that were far from being common. The story takes place in a time of peace that takes place on many different planets. The story focuses on the conflict between the three planets - the Death Star, the Death Star's power, and the Force.<br /><br />I personally found the main character to be very likable and at times quite intelligent. The story centers around the three planets that inhabited the Death Star - including the Death Star itself", "\"Karate Boy\" is a great movie. The director clearly knew what he was doing when he made this one--to make a movie with an extremely large budget and cast.<br /><br />\"Karate Boy\" is a great martial arts/rampage movie, but does not work quite like it seems. I don't think there is a single good story element in this movie, and that is the main flaw in the movie. The movie is almost a rip-off of \"The Karate Kid's Movie\" (which is another movie which is just a rip-off of the Karate Kid and has no plot).<br /><br />There is no mystery. I was never very impressed with the film; it just seemed to come and go over and over the last few minutes of the movie. In most movies, there was no reason to watch one movie at a time. Maybe that doesn't matter a lot to movie makers--they just do a terrible job at adapting to a genre they haven't even seen before. What matters is to keep watching and watching and watching.<br /><br />I highly recommend the entire movie, not just for its plot and story. I also recommend \"The Karate Kid\" only if you", "- a real man's man in a time capsule of our own; a true writer. \"The Man who Saved Our World\" by Steven Seagal will be watching as much as it will the next time it is shown on a big screen. It was good enough to have made Seagal's name as one of the great writers of the 80's.<br /><br />- good as Seagal in writing for the screen. It was really good.<br /><br />- a real story about the man that saved the world. It is a true story.<br /><br />- a movie which has been made in the 1970's.<br /><br />- a good adaptation of many great stories, about the man who saved the world.<br /><br />- this is an interesting movie to watch", " \"Starlight\" and \"Black Hawk Down\" are the two best-selling Hollywood action movies of all time. The first is a great, if mediocre, example of Hollywood storytelling. The second one is \"The Patriot\", where the plot is fairly conventional but the characters are compelling enough to not be totally predictable, and the movie has its moments. This is a \"comedy\", as the title suggests. It is also a great, if not the best, action film of all time. \"Starlight\" is a well-produced \"action movie\" like every other Hollywood action movie of the time. It is an action movie. It does not have an audience. They do not seem to understand the plot and feel good about themselves. The actors have more work to do in Hollywood because they have so much money to spend. \"Starlight\" has the potential to be a top-selling action movie, in spite of the fact it is a well-produced action movie. \"Black Hawk Down\" has one of the best supporting roles we have ever seen in a film.", "The plot was very good from beginning to end.

And please don't read any of the comments there.<br /><br />I thought that this movie showed that people who grew of this way can come out of this movie better than others did. Some did not come to this movie at all; I think that this movie demonstrates that people can come out of this movie better than others.", "This movie is actually great, and if you've seen it, and watched it, and know the plot, how it is supposed to work, you have a good idea of what is to come.<br /><br />If you have the chance to see it, watch it all over again, it will make you realize just how good and interesting a film this is, and what some of the best and funniest lines of any kind from most of the films we have seen.

The characters make me happy, but not as I remembered them, so I can't remember any of it.<br /><br />I can easily imagine this film getting old, since I'm a fan of all the good Batman films, like \"The Phantom Menace.\" This film is the worst one of them. The writing, characters, plot, and cinematography are all horrible.<br /><br />I must say I do enjoy seeing all those new Batman films...but \"The Legend of the Black Panther\" is the worse.

This film is worth the price.", " (9/4) <br /><br />I've always liked Michael Moore's films, and this is no exception. He just steals the show. His style works well with this film, but his direction is way off the mark. I'm so glad to also see this film on DVD as this is Moore's best ever film. Not only does this film not disappoint, but it makes for an entertaining and enjoyable watch. This film is still not perfect, I'm so sorry if that is the case, but it does deliver some good moments. I recommend this film to anyone who like Moore's films, especially those who enjoy watching films from a small screen with a small budget. If you don't enjoy Moore films, then watch this film, because it is one of the very few films that can have a good story. There's a good sense of humor that this films lacks, and you actually get to see a lot of what Michael Moore did. If you are looking for that type of entertainment, then check out the film, and don't miss it. I'm sure you will be as satisfied with the film, but if not, stay tuned, and if you enjoy Moore movies, if you are looking for entertainment, then try this film (or this", "There were so many amazing films in the 80s, it was hard to understand any of them.<br /><br />There was always a feeling of nostalgia for the 80s.

The acting is pretty good and the plot is pretty good as well with the main character coming of age in the early 60's and playing the role of a soldier who has to be raised in an era of war. The special effects are nice enough so you can see when something can break the bones of a soldier and even the battle scenes look good.<br /><br />Overall it's a reasonably good sci-fi film and if you are looking for your first great film then don't go out looking for it too much.

In some places, films like this made them unhappy.<br /><br />Well to be honest, I haven't read any other reviews of films that made the 'good' movies any better.

Most of the action scenes take place in a small house, which isn't very scary, especially when compared to the real thing, though there are plenty of other surprises. The actors have a very limited screen time and I'm sure this could be due to a lack of acting talent, but it seems that this was just a small amount of action packed house.

It could definitely be one of the better horror movies released in the past. It's a shame because it's probably one of the most popular movie in 2005 and probably one of the best ever.

This is probably the best movie I've ever seen, no matter if you're not a pro fighter or a veteran fighter.

In this film Tobago is the major pilgrimage center for people who are on the island of Tobago, and as they continue their journeys towards Tobago, more Tobago becomes an island of more people. The island of Tobago also contains a lot of ancient ruins known as \"Tobato\". Tobago can sometimes be found just over the ocean that overlooks the island of Tobago. These ruins are so great that when the island of Tobago was discovered and discovered to date, it became a city on the island of Tobago as the famous \"Tobato\" city was", "-I think the film was based on real historical events.<br /><br />-In it's most famous and recognizable setting - a small village in the middle of nowhere.

I only saw the original version of it when I was a child. I watched it again while I was a teenager and it was one of the first movies I ever paid to see once a year. Since it was made I don't think I've heard any criticism. The acting is good, the special effects are good, the story is good and I really enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />What does the movie have to do with this movie? Well it has to do with a lot of things, mainly its a very strange and boring film that does its own research and is about as boring as a ghost. There are a couple of things I just don't understand: the plot, the character relationships and even the dialogue. There are a couple of parts that are really cheesy and the dialog is completely wrong and really weird. Also there are a couple of things that make this movie very funny: I know the dialogue will be cheesy and the plot will not be that funny, but I still don't understand why a movie like this is ever funny. I didn't find the jokes funny either.", "The movie is pretty much a ripoff from the original The Grifter, only the story and action, but they didn't change it so much for the better. The Grifter was a very good sci-fi film in the early 1970's and by the late 80's, we saw a lot of action, great special effects, and an amazing sci-fi series coming out. The Grifter is based on this movie. It's got some neat little things in it, like the giant space ship thing from the original, and some cool special effects. Not to mention the awesome characters. I still remember the original Grifter a lot. I still remember some of the characters from the movie and when I was younger (which I believe now), I still remember all the special effects from that movie. Also, even though it ended, and it's been awhile since there have been any sequels or spinoffs, this one still stands as a classic sci-fi movie. This movie is also one of the best Sci-fi movies ever made. It's one of the few ones that's only used on TV. So if you like sci-fi movies, watch it. It's not that you can't get movies like this, but you should definitely do it.", "I saw the previews before and I thought it was very good. The movie was a complete waste of time and I must say it was an experience. <br /><br />I love the story, the photography was good, but I like the acting as well. Also, I was very disappointed, the script was awful, the storyline was pretty bad. I was completely convinced that this movie was a complete moron story, and that nobody could ever tell that it was this film. <br /><br />The only positive thing about it, is that the music (for the first 30 minutes) was pretty good, I believe people just loved it.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this movie, and have to say I don't have an opinion of some of the plot twists and the rest of the movie.<br /><br />1.

Just don't watch it if they give you a recommendation.", "\"Hollywood\" is a bad movie and doesn't deserve more than one to describe it.<br /><br />This film needs a rating of 4 or higher. The biggest problem in this movie is that it is not funny or funny at all. The dialog is so weak that you don't even hear a word there. If you take \"Hollywood\" and compare it to this movie, you will get the opposite result. The best part of this movie is the acting. The most important thing is that everyone takes the role of the \"hero\". They should not take on the role of the movie-actor, especially the main character in the movie.<br /><br />I think this movie suffers from the same problems as \"Hollywood\". It is a cheap and boring movie with no idea about the movies they're making, so they use every clich\u00e9.<br /><br />In any case, please, don't waste your time reading this review in any shape or form.

A group of friends and relatives decide to take an ancient stone to protect her. The stone is kept hidden in an ancient tomb in the ancient ruins of a city and when the tomb opens it is revealed that its contents are priceless and that its owner is the daughter of a young witch who has murdered her stepmother and her stepfather. He uses the stone with his wife and their children to protect the stone when the witch seeks to murder the stepmother and the children in order to bring the stone to the tomb. <br /><br />At the same time the villagers plan to attack the stone and when the villagers arrive on the stone's surface the stone is shot, causing it to fall over and fall back into the tomb. When the villagers come into contact with the stone they are shocked to see that they are in fact being attacked.<br /><br />The film is set in a very primitive world and it is very slow and confusing at times as the villagers are being attacked by zombies that are attacking them in a very slow, painful way. The film does give the impression", ". I give this movie a 10 out of 10 due to the cast. I'll be the first to admit that some of these characters are all pretty damn funny. A girl who makes good friends with a vampire in college (and then falls madly in love with a killer that she suspects of her own murders), a girl who gets trapped in the closet by a vampire and a woman who wants to take over her life. <br /><br />I guess the only problem I have with this movie is that the characters are very, very thin.<br /><br />But that's the last point. A couple of hours after a couple of hours of watching the movie, I was still not able to figure out who the director was.

It was supposed to be a very funny and very stupid movie. I don't think a lot could have been worse than this movie. It was supposed to be a great story, with a really good cast and a lot of acting going for it. Just plain stupid.

I can't believe I have watched it for almost 10 years, and I can't believe that so many people actually watched it and liked it all the way through. I watched it because it's so easy. It's amazing. It's just that every time I sit back and watch the show I realize how great this show really was until I realized I hadn't really seen it at all!<br /><br />That's one of those things that make an amazing show really great.<br /><br />What I found out about the show was that I can't stand David Lynch, the whole show is just so bad it blows my mind all the time it seems, but to me the show was so great that, because of all that I didn't like it, I loved it and I hated every show that had it, and the show that really helped me make my life better!<br /><br />There are several things about The Sopranos I couldn't figure out why.

If you're a dancer, you go to see \"The Dance of Fire and Ice\". The whole story revolves around getting the girls to dance and the girls in the film are very cool and good with each other. I was 5 and I remember that I fell in love with these girls. I think it would have been a very touching film if they had given it a lot more love instead of giving it the most out of it. \"The Dance of Fire and Ice\" is a very moving and thought provoking movie. It deserves to have been shown in a school or a movie theater every couple of years.", "I was very disappointed to see that the film was not included. The film is one of many that I've read about that may have been done in the 1980s. Unfortunately, they failed to include the movie in my \"Best Of\" collection, so the films I have listed aren't even in there.<br /><br />The film does appear to be well acted, though that might have saved it from being ranked as one of the worst in the history of horror films.

I thought I'd say it was not a funny movie, because the story is about someone (a woman with a broken leg) who has a girlfriend... but the girlfriend was not exactly who I wanted to be, so it took an effort to keep her interest.<br /><br />This movie has been made to have been funny in the first place. If it was the funniest movie I'd found, I still think I'm in a minority, at least in my opinions. The acting by the actors was perfect.

This is a decent flick, but I find it to be a bit shallow for some reason. The only good scenes are the ones from earlier in the film. One is when the villain and his henchmen attack a group of kids, and one of them gets shot by his buddy. The others are in the same area. The script is poor. It just makes you want to turn the TV off, and you want to watch the movie over and over again, and then turn it off again.<br /><br />This was a horrible movie. Don't waste your money!", "- <br /><br />I just went through this film with no expectations, just a great time. It is a great film, although it wasn't as much about acting, but it is what you watch. It does not disappoint. I was happy to see Richard Linklater as Professor Kratz again.<br /><br />- <br /><br />The music, especially the rock, is OK, as are the jokes about being a homosexual, but the film doesn't really try to put anything back to the character. It tries to, and it does it in a good way, but isn't as good as the movie it was made for.<br /><br />The film does need some action because of the death of the main character, but that isn't very important in the least.<br /><br />The film has good writing and acting, and a nice score, as I said I liked the music but it was not in the movie.<br /><br />It just needs some other kind of action and comedy, but it isn't one that I would recommend to anyone who likes to watch great comedies.<br /><br />- <br /><br />Overall", " and if you watch it, you'll have a good idea why.", ".

If this version is not the right film for you, you can go see it.

I wish that they had done a more subtle version or a worse movie.<br /><br />The only bad thing about the movie is that the lead actress is really bad...and I'll take that back.

The 'Man In THE RAUL OF THE CHANTER' wasn't about the mystical or super powers of the demon, it was about the supernatural. It was focused on the supernatural. The story of the movie was simple and simple. The main problem was that the characters were too weak and boring. 'The Phantom' was like 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'.

No spoilers before you even get to the movie.<br /><br />The acting was just good. It was great. They all did a good job, but unfortunately that is too much to list.<br /><br />The film does lack some great elements, such as the original. This is because they didn't use much animation. When they use an animation it's pretty bad, but it is a bit better than what the original did, and if you watch the movie, you can tell right away if they used much less animation.<br /><br />Another thing was that the special effects were very good.

It's a fun movie, but it fails to connect to that original story. There are also some really creepy moments. The acting from the leads is actually rather terrible, and the story line itself is so contrived and silly. I'll give the film a 9 out of 10.<br /><br />The ending is actually funny, but the whole movie only makes you laugh. The main bad thing about this film is the dialogue, which is a tad annoying. It's so boring I don't even watch it again. But to get an overall rating of 9 if you're watching it in your head, go ahead and go watch it over and over again. If you're not watching it, don't bother!", ". <br /><br />This is also the very first movie ever made with the word \"cinematography\" in mind, and is not a horror movie. The story is about a group of school kids who decide to move to a bigger house. To start, the parents have a problem. They live in a very small house because of the weather, and the two of them try to get to work when the weather gets dark... but no matter how hard they try, they get to the next door neighbor who rents the house. What's happening in the house causes the two parents to end up on the wrong side of the wall... in fact, they are at the wrong time when they get out of the house. The children then decide to get into a car and drive away from their parents... but they get in the wrong car at the wrong time. What's going on?<br /><br />The actors are decent, they were good actors, I thought. It was very nice watching A group of kids drive across the street, see a tree, get in their car, go in their car to go back to the kids, and get out of their car when the rain stops. The acting was also okay, it was so realistic and", "I thought that this movie was well thought out and thought out, but it's not. The movie moves at a fast pace, and I was hoping that it would not run out of ideas. The script was very predictable and predictable, and it made me think about why movies end up ending up doing something that shouldn't. The plot wasn't interesting, but it made me think how horrible we have gotten back in the 70's, and this movie was like that.<br /><br />The movie seemed to be just going by the plot line, and it was so long. The one thing I enjoyed was that this was a comedy. Some of the characters were nice, but they were all just wasted in this movie.<br /><br />The music isn't really on point, but it was alright in it's own right. Overall, this is a movie about a group of friends and a time where they all felt their lives were in the wrong place and were just trying to make ends meet.<br /><br />2/10", "\nThis movie is not just about the death penalty but also about the family and friends of the murderer, and the consequences and consequences that life has to face if you ever want to commit a crime.<br /><br />This movie is definitely worth watching.

Then I think you'll enjoy it a lot.<br /><br />I guess you get the impression that \"Lawrence of Arabia\" is a remake of the original.<br /><br />This is definitely not the best movie. It has the same elements, but also the same ideas, which are missing from every other movie I have ever seen. For the most part, the film is a very simple one. It doesn't really matter, as long as you go on in it. In order for the story and the action to unfold, the movie has to begin somewhere, something that I like to do often, in my movie: \"Lawrence of Arabia\", a very intelligent movie that offers the best in suspense for its time and for its entertainment.<br /><br />If you like the good old times, or even the \"Lawrence of Arabia\", you", " and this is an incredible movie!<br /><br />The writing was wonderful. The acting was brilliant. The special effects were stunning. The costumes were stunning. The plot was gripping. And it's pretty obvious that this movie is going to be a cult classic!

In the movie they talk about what it is to be able to create, and what it is to be successful. So what? They try to be funny, they talk about how great it is, but they don't realize that most people aren't just a bunch of girls. And that's okay, because that wasn't the case with this movie. <br /><br />After seeing this movie, I was so envious, \"Wow!\" That was one of the best lines I had ever heard. It went from funny to depressing, to heart-pounding, to uplifting to a lot of tears in my stomach. It was so profound. I remember watching the other night watching this movie and feeling like every time I walked into the theater, the audience would look at me like they just walked down the street and I would turn and say, \"I just went and walked to see a song by the band!\" I was absolutely blown away for the film. <br /><br />It was a real", ":<br /><br />Suspense for the rest of the movie is very good :<br /><br />-a little bit of \"noir stuff\" but i loved \"A Very Bad Day at the Museum\" and \"The Sixth Sense\".<br /><br />-a nice soundtrack of \"The Third Sense\" as well.<br /><br />-hope you had a good time :D", "\"Dangerous\" (1958) starring Sidney Lumet and Robert Cummings as a couple who are both in a state of panic after their house is suddenly torched by a mysterious figure.<br /><br />Set in rural India in the 1930s, this film centers around the life of a man who has come up with the idea of bringing back memories of his own murder.<br /><br />In the 1970s, the idea started to gain steam, and \"Dangerous\" quickly became one of the most popular films of all time. It was shot in such a style, and the film does not shy away from its disturbing themes. The scene in which the heroine finds herself at the head of a mountain is quite well done, as you remember that the main character of the film is the very same type of man involved in the murder. Unfortunately, many of the scenes in \"Dangerous\" are quite disturbing. For example, one such scene is a flashback where \"Dangerous\" was shot at the height of its popularity, and was not until the present. However, in a better shot this scene is clearly shown, and shows it to some extent during the film. Another major problem with this film, is that the acting of Sidney", "HBO's first attempt at a feature film was titled 'The Return of Sam' in 1968. It was released in two parts (the third part being a documentary of Dr. Charles Lindbergh's medical residency at a private hospital (where Lindbergh's son was being treated); while the third part is devoted to the final scene of the docudrama, \"The Return of Dr. Charles Lindbergh\". 'The Return of Dr. Charles Lindbergh' was essentially a documentary about Lindbergh in his last days.<br /><br />In one scene he has a dream about his son being reincarnated into a human being, or even a horse, and then the real Dr. Lindbergh, in his final years, is reincarnated as a horse as was the real Dr. Lindbergh during his time.<br /><br />This is a bit of an overstatement, not to say that the film is not controversial or controversial, but the film's focus on what Lindbergh claimed to have done is quite well executed. He said that he claimed that an ancient horse would become something very similar to his own and that he himself would become an ancient horse.<br /><br />Although the film is rather controversial, it", "Buddy Holly is a little different. While he's a good actor in this movie, he's not good, and he doesn't really show up in any other films of the '80's and '90's. He's not a bad actor, and he doesn't show up in any other films of the year. In fact, this film is very far from \"Buddy Holly,\" and you can see the differences between his character and that of the other actors in the film. Holly is just not very good.<br /><br />The acting and direction are excellent. In this movie, Holly is basically the usual bad guy, and his performance isn't a surprise. In the movie when one guy dies, you have no idea that it was Holly's killer, just that he didn't show up in any other film about this subject. There really is no mystery here; only a sense of being at the mercy of what happens to others.<br /><br />It's hard not to take the director's words seriously, because there is one major issue with the film, namely the pacing. In the film, it takes a while to get going, and then the pacing shifts back and forth between the different scenes.

At that time, it was only a few days later that I noticed that I would be getting the DVD version of that film. A week after I rented it, I found out that the DVD version of Friendship is Magic, which I have not seen in a while, was now available on the Japan video channel. This is the only movie I've seen of this original Disney cartoon series and is one of the few animated series made by Ponyville. In fact, this animated series is my favorite animated series of all time, and is rated #1 on IMDb as an adult material (and also as a child on YouTube). When I got my copy of the Disney cartoon series in Japan, I was surprised to find that it is rated as an adult film. When I returned home after a week of watching it, I noticed that I had already bought another DVD version and it was now available from the Toyama Video channel on IMDb (which I am now very familiar with). I was absolutely devastated and disappointed to see that this movie was rated as an adult (and also as a child", ", where this film was based on (which it was actually based on). The film is actually worth watching if you're interested in all of the details of the real life \"Buddy Holly\" (yes, you read that correctly) - you definitely want some fun to watch. Even though this film was based on a real life event (which it was NOT based on).<br /><br />\"Buddy Holly\" is a very good example of how you should get involved with a REAL person's life, especially if you are an adult.

For a time, it was almost as if the original \"Strangers in the Dark\" had become a franchise. This film, however, was a very dark, dark, dark, dark, very scary movie that you didn't see coming, then you did, and it made you feel bad. That's what you see when you watch this movie - your emotions, your paranoia... and also your thoughts, your thoughts as if you are about to be bitten by the monster. I watched this movie because I hated it, because I loved it. As a fan of horror films, I saw the movie because I was disappointed. The movie was really disappointing. If I hadn't hated it, I would have hated this movie. The problem is...this movie makes you feel like you want me to leave the theater and get something fresh. But you don't. <br /><br />What does this movie really have in common with \"The Exorcist\"- is that it is a horror film which is in many ways a horror movie. The story isn't scary at all, the only thing that scares me is when a", "There's not much else the movie has going for it...<br /><br />The story is very good, very believable as well. <br /><br />A good actor, well played by Jaimie Lewis.", "Funniest movie ever!

It was so much fun--you couldn't help but think about it!", "The only thing I can remember of the film that I watched during the first night was that it's a little confusing with all the different characters and situations. However, as an adult, I loved this film and recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good film to watch and have fun with.", "In my opinion, \"Wanderer\" should really use the phrase \"You ain't dead yet\" instead of the phrase \"I'm so happy.\" I also liked how all of the shots had the same color and were shot in a fairly easy to watch style. The special effects were very good, the sound effects were good and the camera angles were good. The special effects were also very good, the story was good but mostly it was a mess but not much else about it. If you're looking for a movie that has it all, get \"Wanderer.\" I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of science fiction, fantasy, horror, and any sci-fi, or a fan of all the above genres.", "\"The Lost Battalion\" is a perfect example of a film that could have been a great horror-comedy. The film starts with the group going to South Africa on a mission, but the only problem is that after going there, they're discovered by the group and it's up to the police to help. The film has it all, characters, scares, and twists, and it's all so well paced that most of the action is just a good thing: a group of young men and women on a mission, trying to make sense of problems that have arisen in their lives. Unfortunately, the film is so poorly executed that it's hard to see what to make of it all. The music is terrible, the camera movements are bad, the sound effects are awful, and every time they say something stupid, it sounds silly. It's a shame that the movie didn't get better in the end.<br /><br />There's no other way to describe this movie, and that's my own personal opinion. It really is a disappointing film, and you really will not like it.

As an adult, the storyline was a lot different than what I remember from high school. In high school, I loved it and enjoyed it, but since then, I think they changed it a lot for me. But this movie is so unlike my high school version that it still stands out as being a masterpiece. I mean, it reminds me of the high school version (which is also very good). But the movie isn't so awful I can't remember the story. <br /><br />What I'm talking about here is that it's such a great movie and if you like low budget, low budget movies and don't mind high budget films, this movie is definitely worth watching. The acting is great and I wish that they would do a better cast for the movie. One thing I really enjoyed was the acting of a very talented and smart girl.

It does have a few plot holes, you really don't know what's going to happen. So this movie is definitely worth your time and you can make the movie in 90 minutes if you are interested.

The main fault of this movie is the movie made in 1983 - not 1980. The original 1983 was one of the best movies ever made - not even in the 80's. However, the problem (I think) with this movie is that it doesn't try to be any funny anymore - it seems to be more a parody of the original 1983. There is so much humor and jokes about this film that, although the original 1983 is OK, it isn't fun anymore. I will admit that some of the jokes have a little something to do with the humor that I believe is present in 1983, however - it isn't really funny anymore.

For instance, it isn't as bad as, say, 'Tough Love' or 'A Brief History of a Murder'. However, this is also a film where I believe it's a 'bad' 7,000 times worse compared to another 'good' film.<br /><br />In the end, I think 'The Exorcist' is an excellent film which does so much better than that 'good' film that it's far too easily dismissed by its critics.", ") It is actually quite a beautiful film.

The \"happy ending\" is in it's entirety, but is just that. So, if you like Freddy Krueger, do not see \"Fools.\" If you like \"Fools,\" do not see \"Fools.\" If you want to see an actual Freddy Krueger film, do NOT see \"Fools.\" \"Foolish Kid\" doesn't have the look or feel to \"Fools,\" and it's not the same \"Happy End.\" So do NOT buy \"Foolish Kid.\"", "It will surely have a happy end.<br /><br />", "The movie follows the adventures of a group of friends, played by Ed Harris and James Blaine.

In one of the funniest scenes in the film, you find yourself making fun of people who are talking about their love life and relationships, but you can't help but chuckle.

The film is a very well", "I've always been a big fan of \"Fantastic Beasts\" and I think this is one of the best new entries to the series.The animation is top-class and the cinematography is so good I'm sure it will be on everyone's list.<br /><br />However, this one is too far off.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the original series, that they'll enjoy this movie; with the good, excellent storyline, and the \"superb\" cast (including Lupita Nyong'o), as well as even better casting (including Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets actor) in this one.", "I saw this movie at the movie theater and I got it before my sister saw it. I didn't say it was great but it was entertaining enough to do. It wasn't a bad movie but had some serious problems when it got to low budget.<br /><br />The cast in this movie is just fine. John Cusack is pretty good but he is a real hokey jerk. There are some good moments with John Cusack and he is actually funny though.<br /><br />The writing and directing is OK, it just needs a few laughs. The acting didn't really stand out in me. There are some funny moments in some scenes and maybe the acting wasn't bad. But the writing is okay and there is some good action scenes. I guess if you want to see a great movie then watch it because you will find what you are looking for in a movie with a great cast.", "A friend told me he was going to have to rent this film. His friend had to get a copy, which was a little scary.<br /><br />He liked the concept, but said there was not enough money for it, so he sent out a text message with a picture in his email in regards to the DVD. We did meet two friends with whom he had read the letter of no return. They said that the DVD was not for him, because his brother had read the note, and had told him that it was for his friend's friend. One friend said that the DVD was not for him, because he told him that it was for other people. In the end, his friend saw the movie, and said he'd be happy to rent it. He said nothing.<br /><br />In the end, I rented it. I was completely stunned.<br /><br />I don't know what happened next (maybe the video itself was a mistake), but I knew what it was meant to be that I didn't like. At the end of the movie, I just thought that I understood what the film was trying to say.<br /><br />There are some great ideas to have seen over the years. For example: A", "A true gem of a movie, with great music, great performances and a great feel for the characters. The movie is a real one to put on a watch, and the soundtrack is awesome.<br /><br />I am one of those people who watches a lot, and just want to see one new movie. I'm looking forward to seeing the DVD that is being released sometime in the middle of the summer.", " of my collection, I didn't really appreciate the first of the film's flaws, but I was hooked. This movie is full of plot holes and inconsistencies. As someone who has watched many of the worst films of all time, this movie is pretty obvious where it has holes. It's the first I had a problem with. The movie has a bunch of characters with no motivation, and the story is completely implausible. To say I'm a big fan of The Shining and The Naked Gun would be a big understatement, but in this case, I was pleasantly surprised with how great this movie was for the first time. <br /><br />As I said, this movie is a complete waste of time. It's just not good for anyone and it's just not fun to watch. I'd give this movie a 10, and I give it a 3/10.", ": <br /><br />The plot seems to fit around these two groups of characters. The only bad thing here is that the two characters seem to be on opposite sides of the situation. If these two are going to get together, they should have at least agreed that they're going to keep the same amount of things, and at least a chance to talk about some of the things between them in the end. As the movie goes on, the two guys start getting married, and start getting into their own little lives.<br /><br />As for the romance between the two characters, I would never recommend watching it because you don't actually really care at all about the characters or the story.<br /><br />Final warning -- if you enjoyed this movie, you'll probably want to stop.", "The film is one of those comedies that are only mildly amusing, so I think it is also one of those that is completely forgettable. Sure it has its flaws, but it is so good, so entertaining, it is just so good that you need to sit through it. I can honestly say that it is one of the funniest films of all time. I wish I could say that it is not, only because it was such a good movie.<br /><br />But I just hope that the people that watched it have not heard it on film, because some of them have!", "I could take every moment in this piece of work, to the point where the film made my wife giggle with excitement, but I could not comprehend what it meant to me.<br /><br />I can not say that this was ever the best film I've ever seen, but it's definitely not the worst film I've ever seen, I mean the same as in \"Babylon 5.\" It has everything I've come to expect from this film, it is pure and unadulterated entertainment.<br /><br />If you're looking for a movie that has you wanting for the night and still wants to be a family you've found this one, you should look elsewhere.", "The most interesting parts of this movie were the costumes, props, and music. The costumes, props, and music were all awesome, and the acting was excellent as well. My friends and I all got sick of the music. I'm not sure if the other reviewers were, but it was great to see the actors playing their roles, the jokes were hilarious, and the action sequences were interesting and memorable. Overall, definitely one of the top movies of 2010.", "\"The Lord Of The Rings\" is one of those movies that only exists to promote a particular genre of films, not a movie that gets anywhere near as many box office hits as the others. However, that's not what happened here. The problem is that there weren't one or two notable stars in the cast. This wasn't as bad as it could have been. It doesn't say much, actually. There were only three or four people who really had any relevance to the story. There were only a handful who I didn't know were part of the story. There wasn't even anyone who was supposed to act as a spoiler when they got to the end. I felt bad for the audience if everything involved was a mystery, even that, the people didn't really do anything to make it as good as \"The Lord Of The Rings\". <br /><br />The actors were pretty good. Peter Jackson, Jon Voight, Steve Buscemi, and George Lucas were all good, but the problem wasn't really that the actors didn't have a lot of talent. The problem was that all of them got to do things that made them seem like they were having fun, even though the \"action\" in fact was a complete bore. I'm not", ". If you're a die-hard 'Dangerous' fan, I think you're well served by this movie.<br /><br />First of all, this movie has no pretensions.<br /><br />I was curious about the plot and was surprised the first one was even offered. In fact, I was surprised at the ending. For a movie to be true the characters must be alive for real, not dead and there are very few in this movie. It's sad. It's hard to make a movie like this work in some theatres. <br /><br />To be honest, I was very disappointed watching the second movie. <br /><br />But as someone who watched two other movies, this one was the most enjoyable they have ever made...<br /><br />I also thought the ending was great, though the first ones were quite disappointing.<br /><br />What were you hoping for?", "A great film with no spoilers, I am sure. If you like seeing bad movies, then you'll love this film. But if you like good movies, then you are probably a fan of this film.", ": First, let me say that I really enjoyed the movie so I rented it. But I also love all the characters. They are cool, charming, and likable.<br /><br />Secondly, if I were to compare them all to the best of the movie, I would probably say \"Memento\". I really like all the cast and the plot. It is an enjoyable, entertaining little movie. I would love to see more of Memento and the movie. And I hope more of Memento is shown in films like \"Man With No Name\", \"Pulp Fiction\", or \"House of Frankenstein\".", "The script is absolutely awful. I can't believe that someone has a script that is as good as this, but I do understand who wrote the script. I hope I'm not missing anything.<br /><br />It's like one of those movies where the director uses a bunch of kids to try and pull them out of a movie. It's like they're playing with something that would never happen.<br /><br />Also I understand the movie is based on a novel by William M. Moore, but this is just plain old \"boring\". The actors, scriptwriters, and even the director have a reputation that goes back to all the greats of film.<br /><br />The acting is terrible. Nothing special. The sets are badly done and badly painted. I'll not spoil the plot for anyone else but the film itself. The dialog is just awful, the direction just too bad, and the acting is just terrible.<br /><br />I will tell you this: If you like bad movies, you will love this one.", " and what makes a movie that so much fun to watch as well. I mean, a lot of people don't like it, and that's one reason why I say I'd even love it if it was actually released sometime in the near future. That being said, if you're a fan of the original trilogy of \"Lord of the Rings\" then, as well as the ones in the original books, then this movie might be for you.", "\"The American Dream\" is actually funny. I'd been expecting it to be laugh, but for reasons other than to shock. This is, in no way, better than \"The Great American Movie\". The American Dream is basically an endless series of hilarious events that make you laugh and a bit of pain to experience. The ending, at most, is very funny, and is a nice twist. The film is made by someone who actually does know a bit about comedy. It was made for the Comedy Channel, and I'm glad that I was able to see it. In fact, I enjoyed the film quite a bit. There are a lot of memorable and well-written moments.<br /><br />*** out of ten****<br /><br />*** out of 10<br /><br />** out of 10***<br /><br />* out of 10***", "\"Saving Private Ryan\" (1939) is an important film about a man's desire to save one's family from the evils of organized crime, and in the wake of the events of that fateful day, begins the process of making sure these criminals continue unscathed, and their actions are never exposed. It's a deeply moving film, and one that will have many fans around the world. It has a great script, very moving and heartfelt performances and a great storyline that will keep you guessing whether or not you'll see this film again later this year. In some ways, it's a great way to spend the summer. It's a great way to learn about the history and symbolism of organized crime, and even if you are a die-hard criminal, there's still plenty of time to study the film. The film also features a fantastic soundtrack. I can honestly tell you that I'm not a fan of those that compose this score. I highly recommend this film for you because it's so moving, heart-wrenching, and full of emotions throughout the film. It makes you feel very, very, very happy. Don't miss this excellent film.", "It seems almost as if the movie had been made for the film industry of its day. While it is not really an original remake, The End of Time is a truly unique movie that should be a classic in the annals of cinema. It takes everything that is good and is more than deserving of being an Oscar winning sequel. <br /><br />Of course, I should say that I have to say that I'm a big fan of many directors that have made great films. In fact, I am a big fan of such people as Edgar Allen Poe, John Carpenter, The Incredible Hulk, The Thing, and some of the best horror and fantasy films ever made.<br /><br />To me, The End of Time is like any other modern horror film. It is extremely well made, entertaining, suspenseful, suspenseful, suspenseful at the same time, with a nice sense of humor and a fun and original humor about the everyday world of the time (even a society as mundane and mundane as the present age...and the future in the USA is going to be like this...)<br /><br />So, if you haven't seen this movie, I have a few things to say...<br /><br />1. The ending", "<br /><br />There is also a reason why that is really not a good reason to watch this movie. This movie has many, many parts that are not relevant. The bad guys try to get to the location, but they don't and the police come and go and try to stop them.<br /><br />Even though I didn't feel like watching the movie (which had nothing to do with this one, the special effects were really good and the characters seemed all right) I still felt like watching it. If you were like me, then this movie would be a disappointment. I don't need to see the movie to feel like I am watching the movie. If you want to know how bad this movie is, watch \"My Neighbor's Cabin\" or \"Little Red Pecker.\" Otherwise you won't be able to enjoy it at all. I don't think this movie should have been watched just for the \"bad guys\" (who look like the cops who get murdered in the movie) but I could see people getting killed in this movie (and getting killed).<br /><br />I'm not going to say ANY of this is good, just because you watch it for the story and the plot. I'm not sure. I", "In \"The Golden Years\", we see two couples, who have been together since the first time. The first time I saw them, they were only about a year apart, but they were already quite the pair.<br /><br />\"The Golden Years\" contains some great moments because the main events, namely that of the marriage was actually very brief at best. The second time I saw them, we saw a couple getting together, but both time they were very brief.<br /><br />The characters are good as well, especially the young couple.<br /><br />The main storyline was very interesting as well, with a different aspect being the wedding to the love of all. And in comparison, the romantic scenes are very interesting.<br /><br />The acting is good, although the romance is not very well done.<br /><br />The score by the composer, was really good, especially in the scenes where they were making love to each other. Also, when the scene were to end, the music would be played. But the ending also is very interesting. In the end, the romance was finally born.<br /><br />Overall, well worth watching.<br /><br />7/10", "It was the first time I had ever seen a film that touched so many themes in my life. I thought I was watching it for the most part because I never really felt I was the center of this film and even though I am a huge Harry Potter fan, I was not sure if any of the characters did what I had imagined, but then there were the people of this film, even those who were not the center of the story.<br /><br />There is a big misconception as to why anyone would want to see this film, there are so many different reasons why it is the best film in the history of movies.<br /><br />1) I feel that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix had a chance to win this Oscar. I also feel that the film did not have the chance for the kind of dramatic emotional drama that the audience could expect. I think that this is the only one of the Harry Potter films that came out in the early years of Harry's life in which a very happy ending, without a very serious ending was the norm. No big deal, just happy ending.<br /><br />2) There is nothing really wrong with the way the actors played this character. He plays the most well known role ever played", "The film had a lot to offer from a technical standpoint--one of the best CGI shots I saw from the director. From the look of it, it was one of the best CGI shots in the history of film. The story, script, acting, and direction are all top-notch, and the actors are all perfect.", "\"The Grudge\" was pretty much a very funny movie.<br /><br />While I don't think that the original was a good one, this version just was a bad one. If you are not familiar with the original then you might not like the old version because of the way it has been edited, but that's okay.<br /><br />The acting is pretty poor, the script is stupid, and the special effects are awful. Although you are supposed to watch it with your own eyes to see what effects are going to happen. I think a lot of people had better things to do than watch the movie because I thought it would be very funny. Even now, I can't explain how people think they can \"watch\" a movie that was shown live on a public video channel. If anyone can tell me that this movie is just stupid, or if it is too funny, then they should watch it and give it a chance. If you are the type like me or someone who likes to have a few beers at a bar that features some funny things, then this is a movie to watch. My advice is if you like the original version, then go watch this one again.", "The main problem with this film is the script. I think it wasn't very good writing but it's still quite good. The plot itself is predictable and the plot doesn't seem to have developed at all after the first hour which is a big problem. The first half of the film is a long boring movie with no direction either but in the second half it is much better. However, it is still a very bad film.<br /><br />My Grade: 1/10 for the acting and the fact that the main character is actually played by a pretty good actor. I think the plot and the story itself are very interesting and that makes it a solid movie."], "sampled": ["...", "...", "...", "...", "....", "....", "...", "...", "....", "...", "- - - - - - - - - -

I'm sorry that I couldn't be clearer on the reasons for this so that I can see why the reviewers may disagree.<br /><br />There were two things that made the film so compelling to me. One was how the film dealt with the idea of redemption. And two, how it dealt with the notion that redemption is merely a moral struggle that requires redemption (which it seems would not necessarily require a moral struggle). I don't think redemption is ever a moral struggle; I think it is an emotional struggle. Redemption is an emotional struggle that involves a struggle for survival. Redemption is not a moral struggle. Redemption, in my opinion, is a struggle for survival. It is neither the struggle for survival nor the struggle for survival that makes the film such a gripping, intelligent, and entertaining, but a conflict that involves a struggle for survival, not against the quest for survival: it is the conflict that separates it from the quest for survival that the filmmakers present. What separates it from the quest for liberation was the stark contrast between redemption in terms of a moral struggle versus an emotional struggle: a struggle for survival versus a struggle for survival. So why did they choose to portray a struggle for survival instead of a struggle for survival", " of The Dead. Some people consider it the best movie of all time at the time.

And that's just saying a lot, but I was too lazy to waste my time watching it. And yet, at the other end of the spectrum, I didn't know what was going on. I was very surprised, and I was quite surprised that the director was still working on it. So if you ever want to see a complete movie in which everybody knows each other, watch this. The Godfather is the best movie I've ever seen. I will not go into the plot, but just say that this movie is one of my favorites.

It shows us a movie with lots of nudity. <br /><br />The other similarity I found with \"Killing Man\" is that, the acting is much better in this movie, but in many films a lot of work is done by actors instead of acting. <br /><br />All in all, this film isn't that great a movie, although it has some great things going for it. It does have some really good sex. Overall, it should really be avoided.

In my opinion, this movie stands above most of Horror movies such as The Sixth Sense or even The Wolf Man. This is my least favourite of the movies in the genre that I watched last night. I really could not watch this movie, but it is a very good horror movie. The main problem of this movie is the use of violence and gore. The scene where an unseen person kicks a vampire that appears on your screen is a very gruesome scene and the blood seems to fly everywhere. I really hate watching movies that use violence, gore and sex, but here this really doesn't care if you are a horror fan, or just for the love of horror movies. If you are not a horror fan, then this definitely does not care. If you love horror movies, make sure you check this one out. If you are a horror fan, then make sure you check this one out.

As for some of the scenes, they're very good and make for perfect movie. The actors, who are the main players in the movie, do their best to give a very good performance.

So, while this movie was made in the 1970s, it was made about 50 years ago; why is this film so boring? This movie is a complete waste of time.

The characters: the young and the old. In \"Battlestar Galactica II,\" most of the main characters were replaced by the characters of the series finale. This meant that the older characters were much more interesting, more important, and more relevant. For example, the story focuses solely on the events that happened at the end of the series. It also took time to adjust in new and different episodes. Also, many of the characters seemed to be old enough to be in their teens.

There was very little dialog in the first half hour, and I didn't really care for the first half, and although there was a lot of dialog in the second half, it simply wasn't very interesting.

On the downside, there was a lot of blood and gore, which I think I might have enjoyed, but it wasn't very good for gore or shock. Overall, I think this film was a big disappointment for the average horror fan, considering the amount of violence and gore in the movie, and that would have been good enough for the overall rating.

The third attempt would just be another example of not being able to make a movie without a good script and a good scriptwriter, the only difference between them is this one did not have a good script, it could have been better because the actors did not even know how to do it.

But some of the songs are just plain boring. In other parts, the scenes of music and romance are so boring and clich\u00e9 you don't even care who is singing or not!

It's hard to see what it means to be able to be in an enemy's army, but I can see how that could be achieved because of the military. I know the end is not the same as what they expected it to be, but I think the ending is very much a little different. The military in general is very difficult, and the soldiers are trying hard to fight their way out of the situation. But if you can defeat them there's usually no problem.

Jean-Pierre Gr\u00e9goire is the reason why I like this movie. It is a story that should inspire the young to go to the cinema and see this wonderful work that is in the works (and I recommend that kids go see it because the work is good and if this is the way you go when you go to see it you will love it).<br /><br />My recommended viewing is Jean-Pierre Gr\u00e9goire's wonderful novel, My Sister's Fire (1938).

But I believe that people should watch the movie because there are people who like the book. If this was the movie at some point, and those who like the movie are not too worried about that, then they should take the movie. It's very good, it isn't too harsh, but it isn't too bad.

You'll also have to watch the series for the entire duration of the series to fully understand it. You'll even be able to understand some of the subtleties.

She goes through a trauma, and she goes through it through a family.<br /><br />- A young woman begins to take a bath in her bedroom, and she realizes what is happening to her. That is an excellent thing, but you'll miss some of the finer details.<br /><br />- The character in one segment has a very simple, yet very complex interpretation of the whole series.<br /><br />The writers really wanted to make a story full of complexity.

I've seen this movie before, and I've never felt more embarrassed when someone told me it's the greatest movie I've ever seen. This movie sucks in EVERY way and has the worst opening scene in movie history. I just wish the director (Paul Feig) would get the money to make this film again. It should have made more money, but that is the only thing that could make this movie any more enjoyable.

The story was about seven people stranded in the middle of the galaxy after being rescued by a Sith Lord. The film takes a lot of great liberties with it's setting, such as having two of the most intelligent and wise people in the entire galaxy involved at the same time in a dark place. However, it doesn't take all that realism into consideration as the film has many elements to give an overall feel to the series which is refreshing in my opinion.<br /><br />The story is set in a time period of a time when the galaxy was very different from our own and the galaxy itself was filled with some things that were far from being common. The story takes place in a time of peace that takes place on many different planets. The story focuses on the conflict between the three planets - the Death Star, the Death Star's power, and the Force.<br /><br />I personally found the main character to be very likable and at times quite intelligent. The story centers around the three planets that inhabited the Death Star - including the Death Star itself", "\"Karate Boy\" is a great movie. The director clearly knew what he was doing when he made this one--to make a movie with an extremely large budget and cast.<br /><br />\"Karate Boy\" is a great martial arts/rampage movie, but does not work quite like it seems. I don't think there is a single good story element in this movie, and that is the main flaw in the movie. The movie is almost a rip-off of \"The Karate Kid's Movie\" (which is another movie which is just a rip-off of the Karate Kid and has no plot).<br /><br />There is no mystery. I was never very impressed with the film; it just seemed to come and go over and over the last few minutes of the movie. In most movies, there was no reason to watch one movie at a time. Maybe that doesn't matter a lot to movie makers--they just do a terrible job at adapting to a genre they haven't even seen before. What matters is to keep watching and watching and watching.<br /><br />I highly recommend the entire movie, not just for its plot and story.

This is a \"comedy\", as the title suggests. It is also a great, if not the best, action film of all time. \"Starlight\" is a well-produced \"action movie\" like every other Hollywood action movie of the time. It is an action movie. It does not have an audience. They do not seem to understand the plot and feel good about themselves. The actors have more work to do in Hollywood because they have so much money to spend. \"Starlight\" has the potential to be a top-selling action movie, in spite of the fact it is a well-produced action movie. \"Black Hawk Down\" has one of the best supporting roles we have ever seen in a film.", "The plot was very good from beginning to end.

I recommend this film to anyone who like Moore's films, especially those who enjoy watching films from a small screen with a small budget. If you don't enjoy Moore films, then watch this film, because it is one of the very few films that can have a good story.

The film is so bad I would not recommend anyone to watch it.", " I just want to make it clear, not only how awful this movie is, but the way I got my hands on it. The whole film is basically a rip-off of Star Wars, and is an extremely confusing mess. There are a number of twists and turns and very little direction or action. Most of the action scenes take place in a small house, which isn't very scary, especially when compared to the real thing, though there are plenty of other surprises. The actors have a very limited screen time and I'm sure this could be due to a lack of acting talent, but it seems that this was just a small amount of action packed house. It was also very confusing to follow the rest of the film, which is a lot of fun. Overall, I highly recommend it to anyone who has the chance.<br /><br />Overall, a really great Star Wars movie, and a must see if you're into the 'Star Wars' genre.", "\"Escape from Hell\" is one of the better horror movies I've seen. Although the film may be a little dated due to the title, I think it is very good. The film is very scary and I can tell what the director may have thought when directing it. The special effects are quite good and it makes it very realistic. The soundtrack is one of the more upbeat horror movies I've seen. It could definitely be one of the better horror movies released in the past. It's a shame because it's probably one of the most popular movie in 2005 and probably one of the best ever. The only negative I can say is that there was a problem with the special effect. When I checked the box for the special effect it should be clear that it is not a film that anyone should watch.", "A small part of the film has to do with a strange little dog named Mr. K.

For the sake of the film itself, I will say that the editing has been a little bit over the top. Perhaps a little over the top. Also, it's pretty obvious that these scenes were shot in the first place. I am so glad that the director decided to do a movie of this quality, and not have the same problems we have with such a movie.<br /><br />I saw the film on its original theatrical release, and I also am glad to be able to view the trailer.<br /><br />This film may look amazing (especially given the acting), but in my opinion it's a waste of time, and it's more of a waste of time for all involved.", "This would be a wonderful movie.

I have seen the original ending, not the original ending. It just changed everything so you never felt sorry for yourself. I feel that this movie, after all of the original versions, made me feel the same way.<br /><br />This movie is very funny. The acting makes you laugh. The movie could have been even funnier. A lot of the movie could have been better. However, the movie was so funny that you really did not want the plot to end.

The songs were great, from the song \"It's Alright\" to \"You Have No Mouth\", and everything in between would never be good enough for this kind of a movie. If not for the acting, this was a waste of time.<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie at all. You just get to see the story and then don't care about anything else and then this movie was just the worst entertainment I have ever experienced.<br /><br />If you do get to see this movie, and you are looking for something to watch but really want to see an action movie with a great music and story, then this movie is for you.

If you look down the watch list of movies, you don't just want to see how much better \"Z\" was, you want to see how much worse \"The Big Bang Theory\" was. If you take a look at the history of \"Z\" we'll see that from the 70's through the 80's people loved the movie. People who loved Z and \"Z\" went to see many classic movies like \"The Matrix\" and \"The Matrix Reloaded\" (although I know there are exceptions, like the first one...but those were the best movies in the 21st century).

The 'Man In THE RAUL OF THE CHANTER' wasn't about the mystical or super powers of the demon, it was about the supernatural. It was focused on the supernatural. The story of the movie was simple and simple. The main problem was that the characters were too weak and boring. 'The Phantom' was like 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'.

No spoilers before you even get to the movie.<br /><br />The acting was just good. It was great. They all did a good job, but unfortunately that is too much to list.<br /><br />The film does lack some great elements, such as the original. This is because they didn't use much animation. When they use an animation it's pretty bad, but it is a bit better than what the original did, and if you watch the movie, you can tell right away if they used much less animation.<br /><br />Another thing was that the special effects were very good.

It was shot in such a style, and the film does not shy away from its disturbing themes.

As an adult, the storyline was a lot different than what I remember from high school. In high school, I loved it and enjoyed it, but since then, I think they changed it a lot for me. But this movie is so unlike my high school version that it still stands out as being a masterpiece. I mean, it reminds me of the high school version (which is also very good). But the movie isn't so awful I can't remember the story. <br /><br />What I'm talking about here is that it's such a great movie and if you like low budget, low budget movies and don't mind high budget films, this movie is definitely worth watching. The acting is great and I wish that they would do a better cast for the movie. One thing I really enjoyed was the acting of a very talented and smart girl.

It does have a few plot holes, you really don't know what's going to happen. So this movie is definitely worth your time and you can make the movie in 90 minutes if you are interested.

The dialogue is very difficult to understand and the jokes are so far removed from the movies. Most often, the lines in the dialog get so many different ways to make it seem that the characters are talking with their minds. I have found it hard to understand how the movie was made.<br /><br />If you want to know how to play the characters well, watch this movie.

I saw the movie in a theater a few weeks ago, and was surprised at how good their performance is. They have the ability to improvise and improvise much better than most directors.<br /><br />The script is interesting, though I do believe it is a waste of money. It shows the US and African Americans as a great force. There's no conflict at all with the war either, so the actors did not get in the way.<br /><br />I thought the acting was great, though I do remember a lot of the \"action\" scenes from the movie.

If you are not an aspiring amateur then I think this is a good movie for you. If you have a little horror and just a little humor then this movie is for you. No one really needs to see this movie anymore because it isn't much of a horror movie as of now. It has a funny premise. Maybe it makes you chuckle a little because if you have not seen this movie, then this might not be funny anymore.

It is just awful.<br /><br />The only redeeming thing of this movie is the movie's original star(s) (played by William H. Macy Jr.)who has given so many good performances.

The rest of the movie is pretty lackluster, except that this movie just feels so flat that it's really hard to believe that the story revolves around any more then 50% of the movie. There are only a few scenes which are entertaining, but they are all boring and pointless. There certainly isn't much to say about the plot, and just doesn't make sense to me.

It does have some elements of humor, some of the humor is funny, some of the humor is funny, and it has a lot of humour, but the comedy isn't great. The main fault of this movie is the movie made in 1983 - not 1980. The original 1983 was one of the best movies ever made - not even in the 80's. However, the problem (I think) with this movie is that it doesn't try to be any funny anymore - it seems to be more a parody of the original 1983. There is so much humor and jokes about this film that, although the original 1983 is OK, it isn't fun anymore. I will admit that some of the jokes have a little something to do with the humor that I believe is present in 1983, however - it isn't really funny anymore. Some of the jokes in the original 1984 were really cool to watch, but the jokes were just plain old bad too, you have to see this film to know why.

As time went on the movie progressed a little bit, and as we got closer to the end we really got into it. It was really nice to find out more about him as he talked the movie away. He's a really nice guy. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie a lot because of the good acting, the well thought out direction and good characterization.

For instance, it isn't as bad as, say, 'Tough Love' or 'A Brief History of a Murder'.

For one thing it is very young and it is not very well known as it was made in 1931. Secondly, all of the actors seem to be in a very different world than those portrayed in this film.<br /><br />One thing is definitely apparent in this film: they all seem to be very different and they don't do all the same things. The women do the usual odd things and they don't have the same style of fashion as the men. In fact, they are dressed just like the women in this film.<br /><br />Even though it is not a well made film. I was expecting something that was much more original than it could be and I expected something that would give great drama and suspense. Unfortunately, the final part is not much", "Trying to put the best face to a film that is, of all time, one of the saddest, most stupid, and downright stupid films I have ever seen!<br /><br />So this is what I was given up for in order to watch this film, and this is what I gave up.<br /><br />I was hoping for a comedy, but when I was shown a film, my expectations were met. There was no surprise, no pretension, no script. The film seemed to be a bunch of hokey actors who just don't know how to put their mouths shut, and who just wanted an excuse to play for no reason, and it seemed to me that if people were able to put their mouths shut, then that would be a film!<br /><br />I had just seen this film, and so many other films, and I was amazed at how little I enjoyed it. The storyline, the cinematography, the camera work. I am a big fan of comedies, and most of the film is a comedy or even a drama.<br /><br />Although I believe the plot was pretty weak, there is definitely something there for people to admire about it, and a laugh out loud ending", "We all know that the actors were good and acted really well. But that's because I did the best I could and I've really enjoyed myself.<br /><br />It was amazing to watch the cast, especially Joaquin Phoenix. <br /><br />If you want to see a great film for a laugh, or just watch with some friends, watch this movie. It will keep you entertained with your friends and the rest the way! <br /><br />9/10", "Lucky for the movie, the cast and crew seemed to enjoy watching it well. And the dialog was just lovely. <br /><br />There might be one criticism I have about this particular movie, that I have a personal bias against it. The only reason that I would rate it even higher, is because it has so much more going for it in it than it otherwise might. Yes, the ending was predictable, but then again, you can see where those aren't the best qualities of that movie.<br /><br />I hope that the DVD release of the video release of this movie is just as decent if not better. It is really, really good and I can't say anything negative about this film. <br /><br />I am sorry to say that this was my third review of the movie. It was more of a mixed turkey with many of the other reviews I have taken in a while. I believe that a person who is not familiar with the movie might find the movie interesting and enjoyable, but then again, that would be very misleading. <br /><br />Please don't waste your time and money on this movie. It could have been a far better product if it had not been so poorly written and drawn.", "<br /><br />This movie took place at the beginning of an inter-gender-separation crisis that had engulfed the US in the 1930s.<br /><br />The American director had to adapt the dialogs because all the characters are in the US from the perspective of two separate cultures, yet they never seem to speak to one another. <br /><br />The dialogs were made by different people, and the actors and actresses were also a lot of different people.<br /><br />I think there was a lot of money making this film. It was the first time I could see the US and Canada's characters in films. This made it difficult for me to identify with American films. All the characters seemed to be in the US, yet they never seemed to speak to each other.<br /><br />The director was quite good at making it seem like each movie had something in common.<br /><br />I liked seeing different characters interact at different moments. For example the movie shows the US characters going through their childhood as well as the American characters' relationship with one another. It wasn't that they seemed like different people, but they interacted really well.<br /><br />This movie made me wonder if the actors", ". I'm sorry, but this movie has really disappointed me. I have watched many of the movies of this type. I hope that this movie is the best one I have ever had the displeasure of viewing.", ". I would not say that this film would have been considered as highly enjoyable in the film world, but it was. At first, I thought the film was supposed to be humorous, but by the second half, the film was absolutely horrible and boring. First of all, the dialogue is terrible. In one of the funniest scenes in the film, you find yourself making fun of people who are talking about their love life and relationships, but you can't help but chuckle. And then you realize it goes on forever, and it doesn't get old. I was surprised, because the film actually gets you to laugh while watching it, though. (The plot is not particularly interesting, although, it is interesting.) If you have been through \"Dazed and Confused,\" \"Savage\" and the like, you know that you are in for a really bad day. And don't watch it if you like horror, because \"Dazed and Confused\" simply isn't funny. And to add insult to injury, \"Savage\" just doesn't appeal to the average viewer who has an interest in suspense or a plot.<br /><br />Overall, \"Dazed and Confused\" is a terrible film. The cast is a waste, and the script", "Trent Jones as the father's man, and Jason Mitchum as the cop, who also stars in this film. The story follows the events in the beginning. The film makes no attempts to make sense. The police are a mystery. They are not a police force, they are just people who are doing their routine daily jobs.<br /><br />The story does not go anywhere. The characters are ordinary people. When they come in their vehicles, they are not talking to each other, they are talking, they talk, they talk, they talk.<br /><br />This is a film that is not entertaining, and some of the scenes with Jones aren't funny. The police are not credible. This film does not try to make sense. One might enjoy the movie, and find it entertaining, but it doesn't make it worth a viewing. The police are not credible, and they are not even credible, so the film misses opportunities for more interesting dialog between actors. The film does not attempt to make an intelligent film, but instead simply tries to make a film that will entertain. The film is not entertaining, and it is not even entertaining. If I want to watch this film, I have to see it. What I wanted to see was Dennis", "The rest is all jokes! <br /><br />As anyone with a background in movie history would guess, this movie isn't great. It is not great either, in that it is far too long, dull, and boring. It is not even the kind of movie with a twist.<br /><br />I guess it was intended to be about the relationship between the main character and the other characters in the film. But... <br /><br />The movie was about the two couples, and the events in the movie do not fit together. <br /><br />It should have been about the relationship between a real woman and an actress named Anne Marie. <br /><br />But, you can't tell it's just a movie and not a movie.", ". When I saw the film I was amazed. I enjoyed it so much I rented it back-cameras out of curiosity, as if this is another B-movie. But this film is very much a B-movie, and with this, I didn't even know it could be a B-movie at all. In fact, I expected something to get lost in the movie.<br /><br />It had so much potential, especially not the B-movie. I didn't expect something from the film, and what a waste of time I wasted. The acting was so bad I almost lost my heart. <br /><br />If this movie is to be believed, you will never get the chance to see this film without seeing it to my face. This film is truly bad. For those who enjoy watching bad films, watch out, for if you are watching this film with the intention of getting this movie, that is just too bad.<br /><br />7/10", ": <br /><br />A must see!!!", "U.S. Army (aka M&G) is called upon to protect the town of Gremlins from the forces of the Fuhrer as a whole. The town has been besieged by the Fuhrer and other soldiers and has taken over most of the town to keep Gremlins out of the hands of the fascist police. When the film takes place at the village, Gremlins try to break into the town after U.S. soldiers and police have destroyed and burned most of the town, but the police are only able to break into the village with the help of the army. When all the police are in retreat, U.S. soldiers are dispatched. After U.S. soldiers and police break into the village, U.S. soldiers and police break into Gremlins, and the rest of Gremlins are on the run. This film is probably the worst of M&G's works in a long time, and certainly one of the worst I have seen of these kind film. But, the movie really makes no sense. It is so absurd, it is unbelievable! I'm looking forward to more, and more of M&G's films. It could well be called a masterpiece! I don't think I have ever", "Lame movie for those of you who just got the chance to see it. It's not your typical high school drama, but it shows you how to get a good laugh at what they do, as well as how to make good friends, and it's also a comedy that also features a couple of good jokes that really make you care about the characters.<br /><br />Overall, it was well worth watching it. It can be scary and funny, but it also can be a bit silly. However, I would recommend watching it over and over for good laughs, and that is what you see here.<br /><br />Grade: B", "\nThe movie has a good mix of humor, tragedy, and comedy.

Soon, however, the rest of the group decide they've got a good time, making it as easy as finding a bar for the party.<br /><br />This is one of the movie's truly memorable lines, and is well worth hearing from all of the gang members and the gang leaders. The movie is packed full of characters and moments of emotion, and is very much a film about family, relationships, and friendship.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, especially young kids, or anyone who is looking for a great, colorful, fun family movie. As for me, I give this movie a 2/10 because it is fun at points, and this film really does have one of the best lines of any movie I've seen.<br /><br />The acting is simply amazing, as it is really a gangster's movie, and it was definitely one of the best movie I've seen in awhile.

All the men in the movie go to a movie and get naked at an inn and then leave after they have watched one, but only to talk about the next.<br /><br />So the plot has a good one...<br /><br />But this movie doesn't make me feel like I'm watching some erotic movie, and that the sexiest guy is also just a movie.<br /><br />As far as sex is concerned, nothing is sexual. No one in the movie actually has sex.<br /><br />What I mean by that is that even if the sexiest guy is a porn star, you don't get the pleasure of seeing a porn star with the same sexual urges and the same passion and passion of having sex.<br /><br />The only thing about the sexiest guy is that all the men in the movie go to a movie...<br /><br />And there are only about 10 movies which depict sex...", "\"It's easy for the government to shut down a program or two and it's done so without explanation,\" said Mr. Nye. \"I think the CIA should be able to ask the FBI to look into it.\" Ms. Nye said she has no idea where the program took place. \"It's like the CIA was trying to invade Iraq.

This is the main thing: the people who make this movie are always, always at least a bit in love with the person they are talking to. I am always impressed by how one person can make a film that is a complete surprise to the whole audience. If I were director, I would make a film about the person. I wouldn't say that one person is a complete stranger. If he were a stranger, I would make a film about him. I'd make every film I make, because the film is so unique. I would make every film I make, because the story is so fascinating and very believable.<br /><br />However, after a certain point the tension is low.

John Cusack is pretty good but he is a real hokey jerk. There are some good moments with John Cusack and he is actually funny though.<br /><br />The writing and directing is OK, it just needs a few laughs. The acting didn't really stand out in me.

This movie is full of plot holes and inconsistencies. As someone who has watched many of the worst films of all time, this movie is pretty obvious where it has holes. It's the first I had a problem with. The movie has a bunch of characters with no motivation, and the story is completely implausible. To say I'm a big fan of The Shining and The Naked Gun would be a big understatement, but in this case, I was pleasantly surprised with how great this movie was for the first time. <br /><br />As I said, this movie is a complete waste of time.

There were only three or four people who really had any relevance to the story. There were only a handful who I didn't know were part of the story. There wasn't even anyone who was supposed to act as a spoiler when they got to the end. I felt bad for the audience if everything involved was a mystery, even that, the people didn't really do anything to make it as good as \"The Lord Of The Rings\". <br /><br />The actors were pretty good. Peter Jackson, Jon Voight, Steve Buscemi, and George Lucas were all good, but the problem wasn't really that the actors didn't have a lot of talent.

The actors, scriptwriters, and even the director have a reputation that goes back to all the greats of film.<br /><br />The acting is terrible. Nothing special. The sets are badly done and badly painted. I'll not spoil the plot for anyone else but the film itself.

I'd been expecting it to be laugh, but for reasons other than to shock. This is, in no way, better than \"The Great American Movie\". The American Dream is basically an endless series of hilarious events that make you laugh and a bit of pain to experience. The ending, at most, is very funny, and is a nice twist. The film is made by someone who actually does know a bit about comedy. It was made for the Comedy Channel, and I'm glad that I was able to see it. In fact, I enjoyed the film quite a bit.

It's a deeply moving film, and one that will have many fans around the world. It has a great script, very moving and heartfelt performances and a great storyline that will keep you guessing whether or not you'll see this film again later this year. In some ways, it's a great way to spend the summer. It's a great way to learn about the history and symbolism of organized crime, and even if you are a die-hard criminal, there's still plenty of time to study the film. The film also features a fantastic soundtrack. I can honestly tell you that I'm not a fan of those that compose this score.

While it is not really an original remake, The End of Time is a truly unique movie that should be a classic in the annals of cinema. It takes everything that is good and is more than deserving of being an Oscar winning sequel. <br /><br />Of course, I should say that I have to say that I'm a big fan of many directors that have made great films. In fact, I am a big fan of such people as Edgar Allen Poe, John Carpenter, The Incredible Hulk, The Thing, and some of the best horror and fantasy films ever made.<br /><br />To me, The End of Time is like any other modern horror film. It is extremely well made, entertaining, suspenseful, suspenseful, suspenseful at the same time, with a nice sense of humor and a fun and original humor about the everyday world of the time (even a society as mundane and mundane as the present age...and the future in the USA is going to be like this...)<br /><br />So, if you haven't seen this movie, I have a few things to say...<br /><br />1. The ending", "<br /><br />There is also a reason why that is really not a good reason to watch this movie. This movie has many, many parts that are not relevant. The bad guys try to get to the location, but they don't and the police come and go and try to stop them.<br /><br />Even though I didn't feel like watching the movie (which had nothing to do with this one, the special effects were really good and the characters seemed all right) I still felt like watching it. If you were like me, then this movie would be a disappointment. I don't need to see the movie to feel like I am watching the movie. If you want to know how bad this movie is, watch \"My Neighbor's Cabin\" or \"Little Red Pecker.\" Otherwise you won't be able to enjoy it at all. I don't think this movie should have been watched just for the \"bad guys\" (who look like the cops who get murdered in the movie) but I could see people getting killed in this movie (and getting killed).<br /><br />I'm not going to say ANY of this is good, just because you watch it for the story and the plot.

The second time I saw them, we saw a couple getting together, but both time they were very brief.<br /><br />The characters are good as well, especially the young couple.<br /><br />The main storyline was very interesting as well, with a different aspect being the wedding to the love of all. And in comparison, the romantic scenes are very interesting.<br /><br />The acting is good, although the romance is not very well done.<br /><br />The score by the composer, was really good, especially in the scenes where they were making love to each other.

In the end, the romance was finally born.<br /><br />Overall, well worth watching.<br /><br />7/10", "It was the first time I had ever seen a film that touched so many themes in my life. I thought I was watching it for the most part because I never really felt I was the center of this film and even though I am a huge Harry Potter fan, I was not sure if any of the characters did what I had imagined, but then there were the people of this film, even those who were not the center of the story.<br /><br />There is a big misconception as to why anyone would want to see this film, there are so many different reasons why it is the best film in the history of movies.<br /><br />1) I feel that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix had a chance to win this Oscar. I also feel that the film did not have the chance for the kind of dramatic emotional drama that the audience could expect. I think that this is the only one of the Harry Potter films that came out in the early years of Harry's life in which a very happy ending, without a very serious ending was the norm. No big deal, just happy ending.<br /><br />2) There is nothing really wrong with the way the actors played this character. He plays the most well known role ever played", "The film had a lot to offer from a technical standpoint--one of the best CGI shots I saw from the director. From the look of it, it was one of the best CGI shots in the history of film. The story, script, acting, and direction are all top-notch, and the actors are all perfect.", "\"The Grudge\" was pretty much a very funny movie.<br /><br />While I don't think that the original was a good one, this version just was a bad one. If you are not familiar with the original then you might not like the old version because of the way it has been edited, but that's okay.<br /><br />The acting is pretty poor, the script is stupid, and the special effects are awful. Although you are supposed to watch it with your own eyes to see what effects are going to happen. I think a lot of people had better things to do than watch the movie because I thought it would be very funny. Even now, I can't explain how people think they can \"watch\" a movie that was shown live on a public video channel. If anyone can tell me that this movie is just stupid, or if it is too funny, then they should watch it and give it a chance. If you are the type like me or someone who likes to have a few beers at a bar that features some funny things, then this is a movie to watch. My advice is if you like the original version, then go watch this one again.", "The main problem with this film is the script. I think it wasn't very good writing but it's still quite good. The plot itself is predictable and the plot doesn't seem to have developed at all after the first hour which is a big problem. The first half of the film is a long boring movie with no direction either but in the second half it is much better. However, it is still a very bad film.<br /><br />My Grade: 1/10 for the acting and the fact that the main character is actually played by a pretty good actor. I think the plot and the story itself are very interesting and that makes it a solid movie."]}
