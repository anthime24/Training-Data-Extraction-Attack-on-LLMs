Most of the action takes place at the start of the movie but there is none of that at the end. The action is simply too fast paced and unoriginal. So there is plenty of time for the action to make it very predictable. The action is just too slow and boring. The fights are not as bad as some say the bad action movies, but the action itself is just a bore. That being said, it does have at least two redeeming qualities, one is the way that it brings back some of the good old days. The other is the way that the characters are portrayed. Not every single woman has her role as a female, but at least the characters are believable if not stereotypical. Of course the supporting cast was not that good, but I would rate it a three out of ten.<br /><br />I think if you are a fan of action movies, and you like seeing the heroes get stronger or just don't feel the need to kill one another - then this is one movie that's worth watching and will probably keep you interested.'

I didn't really care that he had to do this as a sidekick, but it was fun.<br /><br />But the best line was "My friend told me about this". The end.<br /><br />I've laughed this movie over and over, and I love 'em.<br /><br />But I wouldn't recommend this, except to those who love action and/or suspense in general, but don't have very much money.<br /><br />I don't have a high rating for this.'

No results found for: 'the other guy, as if it's a game. It's a shame that we didn't get better.<br /><br />For me, this movie was just terrible. Just plain stupid. And I really love cheesy, but it's so hard to see in this movie, when you're trying to create a "what if" situation. In terms of acting, I would describe it as ridiculous. There was some nice lines, maybe a bit too many, and it wasn't very funny. But there was no chemistry. There was no chemistry, and it just felt like a random movie.<br /><br />There was absolutely no dialogue. There was no dialogue that came in a straight, straight, straight, straight. It just felt like a random joke. And I actually felt like I just watched a random movie. I was so bored. I just thought "Oh my god, I'm so bored! It's stupid!" And it was, like, all this, like boring, boring, boring. And I didn't care that it was dumb! It just felt like something I could watch. And that's probably what you should be thinking.<br /><br />Some other comments by other people (i.e. "What's up, little one, you're still watching this stupid movie'

The movie is funny, not the worst thing I've ever seen in film history. They are trying to make a bad film, because it's just so cliché, it doesn't matter. The only bad part, the music, is just so bad it's too loud.<br /><br />2. The storyline is basically straight out of a Hitchcock flick. The director tries to give some good bits to a guy and ends up telling him that he IS a crazy person, he's got to'
